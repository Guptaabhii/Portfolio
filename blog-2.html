        <p id="sec-1">Web designers generally have nothing to do with creating content for their 
         projects. Even so, the look of a site can be incomplete if no words are included.
          Web designers need to find ways to incorporate copyright-free content into their
           designs to provide clients with a look that is as finished as possible.

            “Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty,” said Henry 
            Ford, the founder of the famous Ford Moto Company. Indeed, facing the rapid 
         of technologies over a few decades, web developers almost need to keep well-informed 
         unless they want to be left behind.

        In addition to traditional ways to learn, like taking online courses or working 
        on projects, both new and experienced engineers can keep up with the latest news 
        and trends by reading web development blogs.

            While web development typically refers to web markup and coding, website 
            development includes all related development tasks, such as client-side 
            scripting, server-side scripting, server and network security configuration, 
            eCommerce development, and content management system (CMS) development.

            In this guide, we’ll cover the basics of web development, the process of
             creating a website, and additional resources for those who want to learn more
              about development — or become a developer themselves.

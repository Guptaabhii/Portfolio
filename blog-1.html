            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
             when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
             specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap 
             into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
             content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum
              is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to
               using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. 
               Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum 
               as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover 
               many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over
                the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour 
                and the like).

            While web development typically refers to web markup and coding, website 
            development includes all related development tasks, such as client-side 
            scripting, server-side scripting, server and network security configuration, 
            eCommerce development, and content management system (CMS) development.

            In this guide, we’ll cover the basics of web development, the process of
             creating a website, and additional resources for those who want to learn more
              about development — or become a developer themselves.
